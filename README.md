# Voting-system-python
🗳️ Voting System in Python is a simple command-line project where users cast votes for predefined candidates 👤. It uses a dictionary 📚 to store vote counts and announces the winner 🏆 or a tie ⚖️ based on the highest number of votes. Perfect for practicing loops, conditionals, and data structures in Python 🐍!
